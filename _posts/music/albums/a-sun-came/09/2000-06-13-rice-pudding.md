I'm taking you down <br>
To the placement field. <br>
And when I find you <br>
Underneath the grass, I know you <br>
Feel this way, you feel this way.

Because I know you, <br>
And I feel you, <br>
And I'll feed you rice pudding <br>
At the benefit concert.

Yeah baby, I'll feed you rice pudding. <br>
At the concert.

Rock-n-roll, sugar cane.
