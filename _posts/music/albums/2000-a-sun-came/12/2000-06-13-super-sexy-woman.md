She's a superhuman girl <br>
She is Superwoman <br>
She is Superman's cousin <br>
She's got superpower lovin’

She's got superpower eyes <br>
And see-through superhuman vision <br>
She's got superhuman thighs <br>
Sexier than television

She is superduper smart <br>
I like her for her mind <br>
She'll shoot a super fart <br>
The deadly silent kind

She's got superhuman lips <br>
For super suction <br>
She's got superpower hips <br>
For super reproduction

She's a superhuman girl <br>
She is Superwoman <br>
She is Superman's cousin <br>
She's got superpower lovin’

She's got superhuman eyes <br>
And see through superhuman vision <br>
She's got superhuman thighs <br>
Sexier than television

She's a lot like Catwoman <br>
Just without the leather <br>
She likes ropes and chains <br>
And an electronic tether

She's got a superlong tongue <br>
And spandex underwear <br>
She's got Superman's smile <br>
And Wonderwoman's hair

She's a superhuman girl <br>
She is superwoman <br>
She is Superman's cousin <br>
She's got superpower lovin’

She's got superhuman eyes <br>
And see through superhuman eyes  <br>
She's got superhuman thighs <br>
Sexier than television

She is supergirl superwoman super-sexy-woman <br>
She is supergirl superwoman super-sexy-woman <br>
She is supergirl superwoman super-sexy-woman <br>
She is supergirl superwoman super-sexy-woman
