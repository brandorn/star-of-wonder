Mad he was, inward <br>
Break her barn, back door

When the water rushed and poured <br>
Took the relatives she stored <br>
So the Father Ghost and Lord <br>
Took the revelation stored

It's a waste of money spent and given <br>
It's a waste of what was, when forgiven <br>
And your children burn their backs in bed <br>
It's a waste of what your kids won't have

When the man took his gun <br>
Put it on your youngest one <br>
Took the curtains off the glass <br>
Took the virgin for what she has

It's a waste of money spent and given <br>
It's a waste of what was, when forgiven <br>
And your children burn their backs in bed <br>
It's a waste of what your kids won't have
