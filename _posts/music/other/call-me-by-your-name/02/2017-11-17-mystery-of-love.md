Oh, to see without my eyes <br>
The first time that you kissed me <br>
Boundless by the time I cried <br>
I built your walls around me <br>
White noise, what an awful sound <br>
Fumbling by Rogue River <br>
Feel my feet above the ground <br>
Hand of God, deliver me

Woe, oh woe-oh-oh is me <br>
The first time that you touched me <br>
Oh, will wonders ever cease? <br>
Blessed be the mystery of love

Lord, I no longer believe <br>
Drowned in living waters <br>
Cursed by the love that I received <br>
From my brother's daughter <br>
Like Hephaestion, who died <br>
Alexander's lover <br>
Now my riverbed has dried <br>
Shall I find no other?

Woe, oh woe-oh-oh is me <br>
I'm running like a plover <br>
Now I'm prone to misery <br>
The birthmark on your shoulder reminds me

How much sorrow can I take? <br>
Blackbird on my shoulder <br>
And what difference does it make <br>
When this love is over? <br>
Shall I sleep within your bed <br>
River of unhappiness <br>
Hold your hands upon my head <br>
Till I breathe my last breath

Woe, oh woe-oh-oh is me <br>
The last time that you touched me <br>
Oh, will wonders ever cease? <br>
Blessed be the mystery of love
