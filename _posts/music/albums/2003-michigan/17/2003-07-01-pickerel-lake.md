I wasn't willing <br>
To fight on the floor <br>
Throwing the chairs through the door <br>
And I wasn't willing <br>
To fight on the floor <br>
Something to say to the poor

The storms in July <br>
Took off the trees <br>
Took off the place to be <br>
The animals died <br>
Once in a while <br>
Once in a while

And I wasn't willing <br>
To make up the bed <br>
Folding the sheets to your head <br>
And I wasn't willing <br>
To say it again <br>
Waiting for things to be

The storms in July <br>
Took off the trees <br>
Took off the place to be <br>
The animals died <br>
Once in a while <br>
Once in a while
