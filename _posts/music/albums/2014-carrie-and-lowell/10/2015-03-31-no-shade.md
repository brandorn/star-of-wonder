Now that I fell into your arms <br>
My only lover <br>
Give out to give in <br>
I search for the capsule I lost

Drag me to hell <br>
In the valley of The Dalles <br>
Like my mother <br>
Give wings to a stone <br>
It's only the shadow of a cross

I slept on my back <br>
In the shade of the meadowlark <br>
Like a champion <br>
Get drunk to get laid <br>
I take one more hit when you depart

I'll drive that stake through the center of my heart <br>
Lonely vampire <br>
Inhaling its fire <br>
I'm chasing the dragon too far

There's blood on that blade <br>
Fuck me, I'm falling apart <br>
My assassin <br>
Like Casper the ghost <br>
There's no shade in the shadow of the cross
