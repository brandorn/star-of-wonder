I should have known better <br>
To see what I could see <br>
My black shroud <br>
Holding down my feelings <br>
A pillar for my enemies

I should have wrote a letter <br>
And grieve what I happen to grieve <br>
My black shroud <br>
I never trust my feelings <br>
I waited for the remedy

When I was three, three maybe four <br>
She left us at that video store <br>
Be my rest, be my fantasy <br>
I’m light as a feather

I’m bright as the Oregon breeze <br>
My black shroud <br>
Frightened by my feelings <br>
I only want to be a relief

No, I’m not a go-getter<br>
The demon had a spell on me<br>
My black shroud<br>
Captain of my feelings<br>
The only thing I want to believe

When I was three, and free to explore I saw her face on the back of the door<br>
Be my vest, be my fantasy

I should have known better<br>
Nothing can be changed<br>
The past is still the past<br>
The bridge to nowhere

I should’ve wrote a letter<br>
Explaining what I feel, that empty feeling

Don’t back down, concentrate on seeing<br>
The breakers in the bar, the neighbor’s greeting<br>
My brother had a daughter<br>
The beauty that she brings, illumination

Don’t back down, there is nothing left<br>
The breakers in the bar, no reason to live<br>
I’m a fool in the fetter <br>
Rose of Aaron’s beard, where you can reach me

Don’t back down: nothing can be changed <br>
Cantilever bridge, the drunken sailor <br>
My brother had a daughter <br>
The beauty that she brings, illumination
