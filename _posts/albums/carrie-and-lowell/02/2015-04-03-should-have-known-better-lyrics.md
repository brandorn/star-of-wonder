I should have known better

To see what I could see

My black shroud

Holding down my feelings

A pillar for my enemies

<br>

I should have wrote a letter

And grieve what I happen to grieve

My black shroud

I never trust my feelings

I waited for the remedy

<br>

When I was three, three maybe four

She left us at that video store

Be my rest, be my fantasy

I’m light as a feather

<br>

I’m bright as the Oregon breeze

My black shroud

Frightened by my feelings

I only want to be a relief

<br>

No, I’m not a go-getter

The demon had a spell on me

My black shroud

Captain of my feelings

The only thing I want to believe

<br>

When I was three, and free to explore I saw her face on the back of the door

Be my vest, be my fantasy

<br>

I should have known better

Nothing can be changed

The past is still the past

The bridge to nowhere

<br>

I should’ve wrote a letter

Explaining what I feel, that empty feeling

<br>

Don’t back down, concentrate on seeing

The breakers in the bar, the neighbor’s greeting

My brother had a daughter

The beauty that she brings, illumination

<br>

Don’t back down, there is nothing left

The breakers in the bar, no reason to live

I’m a fool in the fetter

Rose of Aaron’s beard, where you can reach me

<br>

Don’t back down: nothing can be changed

Cantilever bridge, the drunken sailor

My brother had a daughter

The beauty that she brings, illumination
