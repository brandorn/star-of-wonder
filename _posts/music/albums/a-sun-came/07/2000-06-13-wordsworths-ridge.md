A summer night <br>
I find a boat <br>
Tied to a tree <br>
A normal home

She lost her string <br>
And stepping in <br>
I push the shore there <br>
An act of stealth

A troubled glad without a voice <br>
A mountain song, the boat moves on <br>
The water runs on either side <br>
The circle swell, a sudden light <br>
Takes me

Takes me <br>
Takes me <br>
Takes me <br>
Takes me

I fix my view <br>
Upon the ridge <br>
Horizon's eye <br>
Above the gray sky

I tip my oar to raise the stroke <br>
The wading swan, the image broke <br>
A looming peak, a pirate size <br>
Uprears its head a sudden guise <br>
Takes me
