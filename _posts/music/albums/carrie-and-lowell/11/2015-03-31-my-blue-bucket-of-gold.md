My blue bucket of gold <br>
Friend, why donâ€™t you love me? <br>
Once the myth has been told <br>
The lens deforms it as lightning

Raise your right hand <br>
Tell me you want me in your life <br>
Or raise your red flag <br>
Just when I want you in my life

Search for things to extol <br>
Friend, the fables delight me <br>
My blue bucket of gold <br>
Lord, touch me with lightning

Raise your right hand <br>
Tell me you want me in your life <br>
Or raise your red flag <br>
Just when I want you in my life
