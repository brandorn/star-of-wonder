Demonstrate I was raised from the start <br>
By a priest and the maid on the part. <br>
Still I know what to wear on my back: <br>
Michigan! <br>
Ponshewaing! <br>
Cadillac! 

If I ever meant to go away <br>
I was raised, I was reaised <br>
In the place, in the place. <br>
Still I often think of going back<br> 
To the farms, to the farms <br>
Golden arms, golden arms <br>
start to remind me. 

If the lakes took <br>
the place of the sea. <br>
If the cars drove <br>
themselves, way to be! <br>
Opposite the trains moving in <br>
Rivers run interstate, Michigan! 

Still I never meant to go away <br>
I was raised, I was raised <br>
In the place, in the place. <br>
Still I often think of going back <br>
To the farms, to the farms <br>
Golden arms, golden arms. <br>
Tried to change the <br>
Made in Michigan <br>
I was raised, I was raised <br>
In the place, in the place, <br>
part to remind me
