I live in America <br>
With a pair of Payless shoes <br>
The upper penisula <br>
And the television news <br>
And I've seen my wife <br>
At the K-Mart <br>
In strange ideas <br>
We live apart 

I live in a trailer home <br>
With a snow mobile, my car <br>
The window is broken out <br>
And the interstate is far <br>
I drove all night <br>
To find my child <br>
In strange ideas <br>
He's been revived 

In strange ideas <br>
In stranger times <br>
I've no idea <br>
What's right sometimes <br>
I lost my mind <br>
I lost my life <br>
I lost my job <br>
I lost my wife
