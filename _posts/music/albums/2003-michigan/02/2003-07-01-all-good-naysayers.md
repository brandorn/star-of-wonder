All good thoughts of righteousness <br>
Is not the kind of thoughts in spite of greatness. <br>
Often not the State is advocation. <br>
If we form a power of recognition. 

Forget loss and perfect advocation. <br>
If it drops or stays in convocation. <br>
All we praise is all we want in commerce <br>
All we praise is parties, foreign commerce. <br>
Entertain ideas of great communion, <br>
Shelter not materials in union <br>
(All we praise is not the kind of commerce. <br>
That's the right solution!) 

All good thoughts is not the act of doing <br>
What we want but what we should improving <br>
Properties, ideas, a woman's pleasure <br>
Is empowered by love, a perfect measure! <br>
(All we praise is not the kind of commerce. <br>
That's the right solution!)
