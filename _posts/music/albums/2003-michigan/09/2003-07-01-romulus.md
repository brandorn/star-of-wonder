Once when our mother called, <br>
She had a voice of last year's cough. <br>
We passed around the phone, <br>
Sharing a word about Oregon. <br>
When my turn came, I was ashamed. <br>
When my turn came, I was ashamed. 

Once when we moved away, <br>
She came to Romulus for a day.<br>
Her Chevrolet broke down. <br>
We prayed it'd never be fixed or found. <br>
We touched her hair, we touched her hair. <br>
We touched her hair, we touched her hair. 

When she had her last child, Once when she had some boyfriends, some wild. <br>
She moved away quite far. <br>
Our grandpa bought us a new VCR. <br>
We watched it all night, but grew up in spite of it. <br>
We watched it all night, but grew up in spite of it. 

We saw her once last fall. <br>
Our grandpa died in a hospital gown. <br>
She didn't seem to care. <br>
She smoked in her room and colored her hair. 

I was ashamed, I was ashamed of her <br>
I was ashamed, I was ashamed of her <br>
I was ashamed, I was ashamed of her <br>
I was ashamed, I was ashamed of her
