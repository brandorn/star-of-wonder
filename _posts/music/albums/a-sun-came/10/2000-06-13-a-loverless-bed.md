Such a shame that I can't get over this; <br>
Put the axle on and roll again.

Such a Saturn eye will close again; <br>
Watching every ring turning again.

And I close my eyes <br>
To everything you've rearranged. <br>
And I close my mind <br>
To everything you've kept the same. <br>
Put the axle on and roll again.

Cannot keep you in my bed again; <br>
Wake up every time, leave your space again.

When the hairline breaks and leands you in <br>
To the woman you've turned red again.
