When she got home from church, Harriet John had the idea that someone had been in her apartment, rummaging around from room to room. Nothing was taken, she decided, but certain things were moved. The spider plant on the bureau had been turned clockwise. A little dirt muddied the doily. The pasta strainer, which Harriet was certain she’d left on the stove, was now hanging over the breadbox. Her Rolodex was open to Z. Who did she know with a last name that started with Z? Her hanging blouses had been separated in the closet, parting to a lavender turtleneck Harriet hadn’t worn since her divorce ten years before. The blinds had been lifted. The floor rug was wedged under a glass lamp stand. Her New Testament concordance was folded dog-cared at the word delusion. Harriet flipped to the printed reference, If Thessalonians 2:11: “For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie.” She quickly hid her bible in a drawer, noticing other things: the toilet seat was raised; the candy jar on her writing desk was overturned. Three black gumdrops made a right angle pointing back at her. Harriet was certain it meant something. A coded message from the intruders, perhaps, or a symbol of the trinity. She wasn’t sure which.
