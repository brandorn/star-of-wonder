We were, we were <br>
We were lovers <br>
We had no one <br>
But armed puppets

We were touching <br>
We were turning <br>
We were eighteen <br>
Get to learning

Saw your mother <br>
At the river washing ribbons <br>
Saw her sip, saw her sip the East River

I've seen lame men up and walking <br>
I've seen deaf and dead men talking

And I have had enough of trouble <br>
I've been paid in full and double

Barricade glass against the table <br>
Break it farmers if you're, if you're able

I went dancing with my sister <br>
Call her madam, call me mister
