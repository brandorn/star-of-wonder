Like the lantern on a tree <br>
Your burden bright as weary be. <br>
Periwig on parakeet, <br>
You're God's great paramour and sweet.

I'm happy, I'm happy <br>
Your birthday brings a pardoning. <br>
I'm happy, I'm happy <br>
You're like a bird that will not be.

Yours will number, yours will be <br>
A paragon a Paraclete. <br>
Keep your bed warm, keep your humor, <br>
Keep your proverbs short and sweet.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry <br>
That life is anxious, life is mean. <br>
I'm sorry, I'm sorry <br>
A pair of shoes is what you need.

I'm happy, I'm happy <br>
Your birthday brings a pardoning. <br>
I'm happy, I'm happy <br>
You're like a bird that will not be.
