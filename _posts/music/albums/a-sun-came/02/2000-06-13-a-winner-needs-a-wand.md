Like it's killing me, <br>
It's kidding me around.

This bite, you bit on me. <br>
You put on me a gown.

That fits me like a quarter door <br>
That hits me like a sound. <br>
It's like you shut on me <br>
Or shouldn't be around.

Like the fennel seed, <br>
The funny gene You found.

I like the man-o-weeds, <br>
The man-o-wars abound.

That fits me like a quarter door, <br>
That hits me like a sound. <br>
I might just win a war, <br>
A matador around.

There's still nothing I can say to change <br>
My news for you. <br>
There's still nothing You can do to exchange <br>
My dues to you.

Like you fit on me <br>
To bit on me a bound.

This life that's shut on me <br>
That shouldn't be the grounds

To emulate an epicene <br>
To elevate a sound, <br>
This life, a winner needs, <br>
A winner needs a wand.

Never want to blame you, <br>
Bound you, blame me, <br>
Never want the blame you bound.

Never want to blame you, <br>
Bound me, blame you, <br>
Never want the fame You found.

And where's the same, <br>
And where's the strong, <br>
And where's the guard, <br>
And where's the one who tries to make you?
