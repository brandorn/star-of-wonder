The only thing that keeps me from driving this car <br>
Half-light, jack knife into the canyon at night <br>
Signs and wonders: Perseus aligned with the skull <br>
Slain Medusa, Pegasus alight from us all

Do I care if I survive this? Bury the dead where they’re found <br>
In a veil of great surprises; I wonder did you love me at all?

The only thing that keeps me from cutting my arm <br>
Cross hatch, warm bath, Holiday Inn after dark <br>
Signs and wonders: water stain writing the wall <br>
Daniel’s message; blood of the moon on us all

Do I care if I despise this? Nothing else matters, I know <br>
In a veil of great disguises; how do I live with your ghost?

Should I tear my eyes out now? <br>
Everything I see returns to you somehow <br>
Should I tear my heart out now? <br>
Everything I feel returns to you somehow <br>
I want to save you from your sorrow

The only reason why I continue at all <br>
Faith in reason, I wasted my life playing dumb <br>
Signs and wonders: sea lion caves in the dark <br>
Blind faith, God’s grace, nothing else left to impart

Do I care if I survive this, bury the dead where they’re found <br>
In a veil of great surprises; hold to my head till I drown <br>
Should I tear my eyes out now, before I see too much? <br>
Should I tear my arms out now, I wanna feel your touch

Should I tear my eyes out now? <br>
Everything I see returns to you somehow <br>
Should I tear my heart out now? <br>
Everything I feel returns to you somehow
