I always knew you
In your mother's arms 
I have called her name 
I've an idea

Placed in your mind <br>
To be a better man, <br>
I've made a crown for you <br>
And put it in your room <br>
And when the bride groom comes <br>
There will be noise. <br>
And there will be glad <br>
And the perfect bed

And when you write a poem <br>
I know the words, <br>
I know the sounds <br>
Before you write it down <br>
When you wear your clothes <br>
I wear them too <br>
I wear your shoes. <br>
And the jacket too <br>
I always knew you <br>
In your mother's arms <br>
I have called you son. <br>
I've made amends <br>
Between father and son. <br>
Or if you haven't one

Rest in my arms, <br>
Sleep in my bed,<br>
There's a design <br>
To what I did and said <br>
Rest in my arms, <br>
Sleep in my bed, <br>
There's a design
