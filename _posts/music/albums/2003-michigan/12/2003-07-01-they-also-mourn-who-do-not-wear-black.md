If you happen to be educated <br>
Time it marches on, <br>
oh time it marches on. <br>
In the end there is a sacred show <br>
delivers every song, <br>
delivers every song. 

Mourning steps and <br>
mourning gallivants <br>
And mourning never shows, <br>
no mourning never slows. <br>
If the avatar reminds that it <br>
will never stand at all, <br>
will never stand as tall. 

Since the water made it, <br>
most to sail it, <br>
made it most to song, <br>
it made it most to song. <br>
For the politics are not political <br>
for what they stand, <br>
For not what they demand. <br>
Every senator and diplomat 
combines her certain part, <br>
A matter for the heart. <br>
Save yourself from recognition. <br>
selfless and quite song <br>
To better get along. 

(We love you. We Chose to. <br>
We made to. We love you.) 

If we concentrate and pull <br>
resources to the highest poll, <br>
To beat the highest pull, too. <br>
Ever will we conquer grief <br>
and find it faster to resolve <br>
the dead, to be absolved <br>
and fed, to restore. <br>
If the advantageous <br>
reprimand misgivings, <br>
We wont grow. <br>
We will not ever know. <br>
We will not! <br>
(Lift my life in healthy places!)
