I would like to throw a field <br>
Yes, I would like to be a man <br>
I would send the Kingdom's field <br>
Yes, I would enter to the end

Blessed is the man who waits <br>
And blessed is the man who starts

"Hey, Shar?" <br>
"Yes, Sufjan?" <br>
"So, what do you believe in?" <br>
"Oh, a lot of things." <br>
"Oh yeah, like what?" <br>

In the middle when you came <br>
Will the animals invite? <br>
Every syllable the same <br>
Every letter, every line
