A break in the clouds is a break in my day <br>
Face the sun of my salvation <br>
As Hathaway Jones would have made it his own fate <br>
Fly by the wings of your creation

On the top of your head, there is a poem <br>
The thought in my head, oh God only knows <br>
As everything else will disappoint you <br>
I used to be young and bold, but now I'm afraid, I'm getting so old <br>
I follow delight to the City of Roses

It's a little-known fact that I can't cope <br>
Iâ€™m the champion of repression <br>
I've had it enough with the east coast <br>
I'll die by the wings of my ambition

The city I left, the city of throes <br>
The one that I loved, the city of hope <br>
As everything else will disappoint you <br>
I used to be young and bold, but now I'm of age, I'm getting so old <br>
I follow delight to the City of Roses
