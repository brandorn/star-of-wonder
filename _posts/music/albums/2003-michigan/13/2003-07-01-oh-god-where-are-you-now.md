Oh God, hold me now <br>
Oh Lord, hold me now <br>
There's no other man who could raise the dead <br>
So do what you can to anoint my head 

Oh God, where are you now? <br>
Oh Lord, say somehow <br>
The devil is hard on my face again <br>
The world is a hundred to one again 

Would the righteous still remain? <br>
Would my body stay the same? 

Oh God, hold me now <br>
Oh God, touch me now <br>
There's no other man who could save the dead <br>
There's no other God to place our head 

Would the righteous still remain? <br>
Would my body stay the same? 

There's no other man who could raise the dead <br>
So do what you can to anoint my head 

Oh God, hold me now <br>
Oh Lord, touch me now
