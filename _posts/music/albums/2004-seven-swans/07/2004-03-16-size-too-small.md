I was the best man in a size too small <br>
You were my best friend, going at it all <br>
What if I put off my inheritance? <br>
Where is the best man? <br>
All arise us all in peace

I still know you <br>
And I still like you, the best man <br>
I still owe you

Everything rises, going at it all <br>
All the surprises in a size too small <br>
And what if I told you <br>
I was still in love with this? <br>
Would you surprise us <br>
In a size for all of me?

I still know you <br>
And I still like you, the best man <br>
I still know you, the best man <br>
I still owe you
