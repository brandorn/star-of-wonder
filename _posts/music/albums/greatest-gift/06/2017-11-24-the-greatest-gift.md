Praise the mountain and the rain <br>
All the gifts that still remain <br>
But the greatest gift of all <br>
And the law above all laws

Is to love your friends and lovers <br>
To lay down your life for your brothers <br>
As you abide in peace <br>
So will your delight increase

As the mystery of the cross <br>
Is the love joy lost, I toss <br>
In the fountain in the rain <br>
But my sorrow still remains

So I run to my friends and lovers <br>
I lay down my life for my brothers <br>
As I abide in peace <br>
So will my delight increase
