Iâ€™m drawn to the blood <br>
The flight of a one-winged dove <br>
How? How did this happen? <br>
How? How did this happen?

The strength of his arm <br>
My lover caught me off guard <br>
How? Head of a rabbit <br>
How? Head of a rabbit

For my prayer has always been love <br>
What did I do to deserve this?

With blood on my sleeve <br>
Delilah, avenge my grief <br>
How? God of Elijah <br>
How? God of Elijah

As fire to the sun <br>
Tell me what I have done <br>
How? Heart of a dragon? <br>
How? Heart of a dragon?

For my prayer has always been love <br>
What did I do to deserve this now? <br>
How did this happen?
