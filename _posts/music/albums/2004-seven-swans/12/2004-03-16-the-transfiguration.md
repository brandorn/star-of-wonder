When he took the three disciples to the mountainside to pray <br>
His countenance was modified, his clothing was aflame <br>
Two men appeared; Moses and Elijah came <br>
They were at his side <br>
The prophecy, the legislation spoke of whenever he would die

Then there came a word <br>
Of what he should accomplish on the day <br>
Then Peter spoke, to make of them a tabernacle place <br>
A cloud appeared in glory as an accolade <br>
They fell on the ground <br>
A voice arrived, the voice of God <br>
The face of God, covered in a cloud

What he said to them <br>
The voice of God: the most beloved son <br>
Consider what he says to you, consider what's to come <br>
The prophecy was put to death <br>
Was put to death, and so will the Son <br>
And keep your word, disguise the vision till the time has come

Lost in the cloud, a voice. Have no fear! We draw near! <br>
Lost in the cloud, a sign. Son of man! Turn your ear! <br>
Lost in the cloud, a voice. Lamb of God! We draw near! <br>
Lost in the cloud, a sign. Son of man! Son of God!
