<p>I should have known better</p>

<p>To see what I could see</p>

<p>My black shroud</p>

<p>Holding down my feelings</p>

<p>A pillar for my enemies</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I should have wrote a letter</p>

<p>And grieve what I happen to grieve</p>

<p>My black shroud</p>

<p>I never trust my feelings</p>

<p>I waited for the remedy</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>When I was three, three maybe four</p>

<p>She left us at that video store</p>

<p>Be my rest, be my fantasy</p>

<p>I’m light as a feather</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I’m bright as the Oregon breeze</p>

<p>My black shroud</p>

<p>Frightened by my feelings</p>

<p>I only want to be a relief</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>No, I’m not a go-getter</p>

<p>The demon had a spell on me</p>

<p>My black shroud</p>

<p>Captain of my feelings</p>

<p>The only thing I want to believe</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>When I was three, and free to explore I saw her face on the back of the door</p>

<p>Be my vest, be my fantasy</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I should have known better</p>

<p>Nothing can be changed</p>

<p>The past is still the past</p>

<p>The bridge to nowhere</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I should’ve wrote a letter</p>

<p>Explaining what I feel, that empty feeling</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Don’t back down, concentrate on seeing</p>

<p>The breakers in the bar, the neighbor’s greeting</p>

<p>My brother had a daughter</p>

<p>The beauty that she brings, illumination</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Don’t back down, there is nothing left</p>

<p>The breakers in the bar, no reason to live</p>

<p>I’m a fool in the fetter</p>

<p>Rose of Aaron’s beard, where you can reach me</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Don’t back down: nothing can be changed</p>

<p>Cantilever bridge, the drunken sailor</p>

<p>My brother had a daughter</p>

<p>The beauty that she brings, illumination</p>
