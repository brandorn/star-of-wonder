Be still and know your sign <br>
The beast will arrive in time

We stayed a long, long time <br>
We stayed a long, long time <br>
To see you, to beat you <br>
To see you at last

I saw the dragons drying <br>
I saw the witches whine

We stayed a long, long time <br>
But I'm not afraid to die <br>
To see you, to meet you <br>
To see you at last

I stole my father's shoes <br>
I pulled His pockets too

We stayed a long, long time
We stayed a long, long time
To see you, to beat you
To see you, to meet you
To see you at last
