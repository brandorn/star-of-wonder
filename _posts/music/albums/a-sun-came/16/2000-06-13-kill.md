He took the stable, <br>
Bred me to be a mare. <br>
Made the brethren able, <br>
Gave me a room.

I never asked him. <br>
I never meant meant to stay. <br>
He dressed the table, <br>
Wore a dress to be my mare.

There's no permanence <br>
When you never leave the stall. <br>
He ran to other wars, <br>
Won't write me at all.

I want to kill him, <br>
I want to cut his brain, <br>
And when it's over, <br>
I know I'll feel okay.

He was a champion; <br>
We were riding side by side. <br>
Into the frontier. <br>
He left me without a ride.

Where did the hour go <br>
When the champions intercede? <br>
He stole the cargo, <br>
Took every chance to leave.

There's no permanence <br>
When you never leave the stall. <br>
He ran to other wars, <br>
Won't write me at all.

I want to kill him, <br>
I want to cut his brain, <br>
And when it's over, <br>
I know I'll feel okay.

I want to kill him, <br>
I want to cut his face, <br>
And when it's over, <br>
I know I'll feel okay.

I want, <br>
I want, <br>
I want, <br>
I want.
