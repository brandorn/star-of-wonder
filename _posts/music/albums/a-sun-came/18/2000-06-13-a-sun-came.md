Everything You are  <br>
Is everything we have, <br>
You're the only good thing <br>
A sun came <br>
Burned our faces round <br>
Burned our faces red <br>
You are still the rage a rock <br>
From the enemy <br>
There is still a house, a cage <br>
For the enemy <br>
When my friends turned out, I found out <br>
There is still a Lord <br>
But I never felt so lonely <br>
A sun came
