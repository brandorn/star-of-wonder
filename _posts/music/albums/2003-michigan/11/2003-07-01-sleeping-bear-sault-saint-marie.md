Oh Sleeping Bear! <br>
Ran to the top and got scared <br>
of what I could see. 

Oh Lamb of God! <br>
Tell us your perfect design <br>
and give us the rod. 

Oh Sturgeon Bay! <br>
Covered completely in sand <br>
And covered in sun. 

Oh Saint Marie! Give up <br>
the rocking boats drowned. <br>
The Captain is done
