Carrie and Lowell <br>
Such a long time ago <br>
Like a dead horse <br>
Meadowlark drive your arrow

Season of hope (after the flood) <br>
Valentine, spurn my sorrow <br>
Head on the floorboards (covered in blood) <br>
Drunk as a horsefly <br>
Climb on the mattress pad <br>
Twist my arm

Under the pear tree <br>
Shadows and light conspiring <br>
Covered bridge, I scream <br>
Cottage Grove shade invite me

I will bow down (Dido’s lament) <br>
Lord of the ancient waters <br>
From the backyard (as far as she went) <br>
Carrie surprised me <br>
Erebus on my back <br>
My lucky charm

Carried by stones <br>
Fairyland all around us <br>
Like a dead horse <br>
Sign of your children’s fever

Carrie, come home <br>
(Thorazine’s friend) <br>
Holding your hands with Opai <br>
Like a dead horse <br>
(Shall we ascend) <br>
Flight of the mayfly <br>
Ephemera on my back <br>
She breaks my arm
