What the water wants is hurricanes <br>
And sailboats to ride on its back <br>
What the water wants is sun kiss <br>
And land to run in to and back

And I have a fish stone <br>
Burning my elbow <br>
Reminding me to know that I'm glad

And I have a bottle <br>
Filled with my old teeth <br>
They fell out like a tear in the bag

And I have a sister <br>
Somewhere in Detroit <br>
She has black hair and small hands

And I have a kettledrum <br>
I'll hit the earth with you <br>
And I will crochet you a hat

And I have a red kite <br>
I'll put you right in it <br>
I'll show you the sky
