Are we to speak, first day of the week <br>
Stumbling words at the bar <br>
Beauty blue eyes, my order of fries <br>
Long island kindness and wine <br>
Beloved of John, I get it all wrong <br>
I read you for some kind of poem <br>
Covered in lines, the fossils I find <br>
Have they no life of their own?

So can we pretend sweetly <br>
Before the mystery ends? <br>
I am a man with a heart that offends <br>
With its lonely and greedy demands <br>
There’s only a shadow of me; in a manner of speaking I'm dead

Such a waste, your beautiful face <br>
Stumbling carpet arise <br>
Go follow your gem, your white feathered friend <br>
Icarus, point to the sun <br>
If history speaks of two baby teeth <br>
I’m painting the hills blue and red <br>
They said beware, Lord hear my prayer <br>
I’ve wasted my throes on your head

So can we be friends, sweetly <br>
Before the mystery ends? <br>
I love you more than the world can contain <br>
In its lonely and ramshackle head <br>
There’s only a shadow of me; in a manner of speaking I'm dead

I’m holding my breath <br>
My tongue on your chest <br>
What can be said of my heart? <br>
If history speaks, the kiss on my cheek <br>
Where there remains but a mark <br>
Beloved my John, so I’ll carry on <br>
Counting my cards down to one <br>
And when I am dead, come visit my bed <br>
My fossil is bright in the sun

So can we contend, peacefully <br>
Before my history ends? <br>
Jesus I need you, be near me, come shield me <br>
From fossils that fall on my head <br>
There’s only a shadow of me; in a manner of speaking I'm dead
