It's the same outside <br>
Driving to the riverside <br>
I pretend to cry <br>
Even if I cried alone

I forgot the start <br>
Use my hands to use my heart <br>
Even if I died alone <br>
Even if I died alone

Since the first of June <br>
Lost my job <br>
And lost my room <br>
I pretend to try <br>
Even if I tried alone

I forgot the part <br>
Lose my hands to use my heart <br>
Even if I died alone <br>
Even if I died alone <br>
Even if I died alone <br>
Even if I died alone <br>
Even if I died
