Light struck from the lemon tree <br>
What if I’d never seen hysterical light from Eugene?

Lemon yoghurt, <br>
remember I pulled at your shirt <br>
I dropped the ashtray on the floor <br>
I just wanted to be near you

Emerald Park, wonders never cease <br>
The man who taught me to swim, <br>
he couldn’t quite say my first name <br>
Like a father he led <br>
community water on my head <br>
And he called me “Subaru” <br>
And now I want to be near you

Since I was old enough to speak <br>
I’ve said it with alarm <br>
Some part of me was lost in your sleeve <br>
where you hid your cigarettes <br>
No I’ll never forget <br>
I just want to be near you

Still I pray to what I cannot see <br>
In the sprinkler I mark the evidence known from the start <br>
From the bed near your death, <br>
and all the machines that made a mess <br>
Far away the falcon flew <br>
Now I want to be near you

What’s left is only bittersweet <br>
For the rest of my life, <br>
admitting the best is behind me <br>
Now I’m drunk and afraid, wishing the world would go away <br>
What’s the point of singing songs <br>
If they’ll never even hear you?
