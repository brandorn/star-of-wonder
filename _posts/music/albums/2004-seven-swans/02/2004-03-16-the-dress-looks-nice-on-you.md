I can see a lot of life in you <br>
I can see a lot of bright in you <br>
And I think the dress looks nice on you <br>
I can see a lot of life in you

I can see a bed and make it too <br>
I can see a fireside turn blue <br>
I can see a lot of life in you <br>
Yes, I can see a lot of life in you

When the world looks back <br>
When the face looks after that <br>
I can see a lot of life in you <br>
Yes, I can see a lot of life in you

I can see a lot of life in you <br>
I can see a bed and make it too <br>
And I think the dress looks nice on you <br>
Yes, I can see a lot of life in you <br>
I can see a lot of life in you <br>
Yes, I can see a lot of life in you
