I have called you children, I have called you son. <br>
What is there to answer if I'm the only one? <br>
Morning comes in Paradise, morning comes in light. <br>
Still I must obey, still I must invite. <br>
If there's anything to say, if there's anything to do, <br>
If there's any other way, I'll do anything for you. 

I was dressed embarrassment. <br>
I was dressed in wine. <br>
If you had a part of me, will you take you're time? <br>
Even if I come back, even if I die <br>
Is there some idea to replace my life? <br>
Like a father to impress; <br>
Like a mother's mourning dress, <br>
If you ever make a mess, I'll do anything for you 

I have called you preacher; I have called you son. <br>
If you have a father or if you haven't one, <br>
I'll do anything for you. I did everything for you
