Shall we beat this or celebrate it? <br>
You’re not the one to talk things through <br>
You checked your text while I masturbated <br>
Manelich, I feel so used

Found myself on Spencer’s Butte <br>
Traced your shadow with my shoe <br>
Empty outline changed my view <br>
Now all of me thinks less of you

On the sheet I see your horizon <br>
All of me pressed onto you <br>
But in this light you look like Poseidon <br>
I’m just a ghost you walk right through

Saw myself on Spencer’s Butte <br>
Landscape changed my point of view <br>
Revelation may come true <br>
Now all of me thinks less of you

(All of me wants all of you)
