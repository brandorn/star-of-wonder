Once in the backyard <br>
She was once like me <br>
She was once like me <br>
Twice when I killed them <br>
They were once at peace <br>
They were once like me

Hold to your gun, man <br>
And put off all your peace <br>
And put off all the beast <br>
Paid a full of these, I wait for it <br>
But someone's once like me <br>
She was once like me

I once was better <br>
I put off all my grief <br>
I put off all my grief <br>
And so I go to hell, I wait for it <br>
But someone's left me creased <br>
And someone's left me creased
