If I am alive this time next year <br>
Will I have arrived in time to share? <br>
And mine is about as good this far <br>
And I'm still applied to what you are

And I am joining all my thoughts to you <br>
And I'm preparing every part for you

And I heard from the trees a great parade <br>
And I heard from the hills a band was made <br>
And will I be invited to the sound? <br>
And will I be a part of what you've made?

And I am throwing all my thoughts away <br>
And I'm destroying every bet I've made

And I am joining all my thoughts to you <br>
And I'm preparing every part for you <br>
For you
