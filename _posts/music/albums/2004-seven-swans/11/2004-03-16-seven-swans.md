We didn't sleep too late <br>
There was a fire in the yard <br>
All of the trees were in light <br>
They had no faces to show <br>
I saw a sign in the sky

Seven swans, seven swans, seven swans <br>
I heard a voice in my mind <br>
"I will try, I will try, I will try <br>
I will try, I will try, I will try"

We saw the dragon move down <br>
My father burned into coal <br>
My mother saw it from afar <br>
She took her purse to the bed <br>
I saw a sign in the sky <br>
Seven horns, seven horns, seven horns <br>
I heard a voice in my mind

"I am Lord, I am Lord, I am Lord" <br>
He said, "I am Lord, I am Lord, I am Lord" <br>
He said, "I am Lord, I am Lord, I am Lord"

He will take you. If you run, <br>
He will chase you. He is the Lord.
