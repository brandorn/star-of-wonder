I'm Aporia's friend <br>
Loneliness rides in my bed <br>
My misfortune <br>
Give everything you've got <br>
While the sun burns hot <br>
My addiction <br>
Spoils my affection <br>
For everything good

Elephant in the room <br>
Might as well shoot at the moon <br>
The mild ambition <br>
Give everything you've got <br>
Jump the Fosbury flop with intention <br>
Pursue your invention <br>
As something of worth

The thing I most regret <br>
Is having to repress what I'm feeling <br>
While expressing delight as a myth <br>
Embrace the epic fail <br>
Of my exploding whale

Poison or powdered milk <br>
Paralyzed as it took <br>
Premonition (What is going on?) <br>
Give everything you've got <br>
Before your life is caught in conditions <br>
Be the first of its victims <br>
The foot of a hare

Action or consequence <br>
My unyielding defense <br>
Superstition (what is going on?) <br>
My attempts to obscure <br>
The wonders of this world <br>
Be it fortune <br>
Or faith in distortion <br>
The patron of prayer

The thing I most resent <br>
Is having to consent to illusion <br>
While confessing distress with my fist <br>
Will history prevail? <br>
My exploding whale

What of a dream deferred <br>
My appeal in reverse <br>
Apparition

Embrace the epic fail <br>
Of my exploding whale
