As if you know the story of Wallowa Lake <br>
Leviathan first hid in the deep where her children sleep <br>
She kept them hidden from the plague <br>
But have you heard the story of my motherâ€™s fate? <br>
She left us in Detroit in the rain with a pillowcase <br>
Fortune for the paperweight

We followed her to Joseph, near the Indian raid <br>
She wept among the weeds, hide and seek, for the fallen chief <br>
Spathiphyllum on his grave <br>
And like the cedar waxwing, she was drunk all day <br>
We put her in the sheet, little wreath, candles on the crate <br>
As the monster showed its face

As she waits for her children in the shade <br>
Demogorgon or demigod the ghost parade <br>
No oblation will bring her back to our place

She stayed within the deep end of Wallowa Lake <br>
The undertow refrained with the flame of a feathered snake <br>
Charybdis in its shallow grave

She gave us one last feature, the fullness of her face <br>
In the shade of "Hin-mah-too-yah" (Red Napoleon) <br>
As the demon took her place <br>
As we wait for the waters to reside <br>
Her remarkable stoicism and her pride <br>
When the dragon submerged we knew she had died
