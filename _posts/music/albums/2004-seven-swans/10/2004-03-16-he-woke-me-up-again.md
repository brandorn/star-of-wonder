He was, he was in the churchyard <br>
My father was in the first part <br>
He came, he came to my bedroom <br>
But I was asleep <br>
He woke me up again to say:

Halle, Halle, Hallelujah <br>
Holy, holy is the sound <br>
And I hope, I hope you are tired out <br>
And I know, I know there is joy endowed <br>
But I was asleep <br>
And he woke me up again <br>
And he woke me up again to say:

Hold on, hold on to your old ways <br>
Or put off, put off every old face <br>
And I know, I know you are changed now <br>
I hope, I hope you're arranged out <br>
But I'm still asleep <br>
And you woke me up again <br>
And I'm still asleep <br>
But you woke me up to be holy
