Once a great place. Now a prison. <br>
All I can say. All I can do. <br>
People Mover: Bad Decision. <br>
From suburban. Now a prison. <br>
All I can say. All I can do. 

From the trembling walls. It’s a great idea! <br>
Everything you want. It’s a great idea! 

Once a great place. Now a prison. <br>
All I can say. All I can do.

Throw them all away. It’s a great idea! <br>

Everything you want. <br>
