Jason, you're the only one. <br>
Jason, like a steady son. <br>
Like that, you're the only one. <br>
Take that, when the runner's come. <br>
When the right dragon comes around.

When the knight horses burn the ground. <br>
Jason, you're the only one.

Jason, like a steady son. <br>
Jason, you're the circle sun.

Jason, run the rabbit run. <br>
Like that, you're the steady gun. <br>
Like that, what the Argon won.

When the right dragon comes around. <br>
When the knight horses burn the ground. <br>
When the right you gave me  <br>
To make it through the night, <br>
When the right dragon comes around.

We were young and noble <br>
Riding on a plane for freedom run, <br>
A plane for freedom run.
