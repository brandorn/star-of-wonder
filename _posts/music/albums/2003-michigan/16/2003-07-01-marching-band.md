One dark day the trees began a trumpet sound, trumpet sound <br>
We sat listening patiently, the sky was near 

And i felt the trembling motion <br>
We ran out to see the future <br>
From the ground  <br>
From the ground <br>
From the ground <br>
From the ground <br>
People died and people risen everywhere

We held hands and made a circle <br>
Quietly, from the ground <br>
Quietly, from the ground <br>
We returned and set the table, by the door
