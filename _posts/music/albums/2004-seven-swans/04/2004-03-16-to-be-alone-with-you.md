I'd swim across Lake Michigan <br>
I'd sell my shoes. <br>
I'd give my body to be back again <br>
In the rest of the room. <br>
To be alone with you.

You gave your body to the lonely. <br>
They took your clothes. <br>
You gave up a wife and a family. <br>
You gave your ghost. <br>
To be alone with me. <br>
You went up on a tree. <br>
I've never met a man who loved me.
