I never felt so safe <br>
A line I once told her <br>
Warm resting place <br>
Her arm on my shoulder

You are the rock <br>
You are the rake <br>
You are the one when I watch myself <br>
You are the rock <br>
You are the rake <br>
You are the one when I watch myself

We ran into a safe <br>
When the walls came closer <br>
She turned into a cave <br>
Where it turned colder

You are the rock <br>
You are the rake <br>
You are the one when I watch myself <br>
You are the rock <br>
You are the rake <br>
You are the one when I watch myself <br>
You are the rock <br>
You are the rake <br>
You are the one when I watch myself <br>
You are the rock <br>
You are the rake <br>
You are the one when I watch myself
