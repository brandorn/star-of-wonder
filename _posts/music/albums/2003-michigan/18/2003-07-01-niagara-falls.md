We had friends downstate <br>
When we drove we went to Canada <br>
If we were asked to stay <br>
I was brave <br>
I was brave <br>
I was brave

From the top of the mountain <br>
You could see <br>
Lake Erie <br>
Niagara Falls <br>
From the top of the fountain <br>
I could see farther than anyone

Driving through the line <br>
We pretend we are from Africa <br>
If we fall far behind <br>
I am brave <br>
I am brave <br>
I am brave
