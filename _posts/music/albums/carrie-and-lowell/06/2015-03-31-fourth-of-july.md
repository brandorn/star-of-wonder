The evil it spread like a fever ahead <br>
It was night when you died, my firefly <br>
What could I have said to raise you from the dead? <br>
Oh could I be the sky on the Fourth of July?

Well you do enough talk <br>
My little hawk, why do you cry? <br>
Tell me what did you learn from the Tillamook burn? <br>
Or the Fourth of July? <br>
We’re all gonna die

Sitting at the bed with the halo at your head <br>
Was it all a disguise, like Junior High <br>
Where everything was fiction, future, and prediction <br>
Now, where am I? My fading supply

Did you get enough love, my little dove <br>
Why do you cry? <br>
And I’m sorry I left, but it was for the best <br>
Though it never felt right <br>
My little Versailles

The hospital asked should the body be cast <br>
Before I say goodbye, my star in the sky <br>
Such a funny thought to wrap you up in cloth <br>
Do you find it all right, my dragonfly?

Shall we look at the moon, my little loon <br>
Why do you cry? <br>
Make the most of your life, while it is rife <br>
While it is light

Well you do enough talk <br>
My little hawk, why do you cry? <br>
Tell me what did you learn from the Tillamook burn? <br>
Or the Fourth of July? <br>
We’re all gonna die
