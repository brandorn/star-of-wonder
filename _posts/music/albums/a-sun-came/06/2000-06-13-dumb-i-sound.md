Something's suddenly unclear, <br>
Someone's suddenly my fear. <br>
My eyes demand like broken eaves. <br>
The ladel overspills on eaves.

If you once knew <br>
How I loved you.

And my bruise-colored eyes peel <br>
Every image to your face and heel. <br>
And if you're happy I am too, <br>
And if you're sleeping, I'm with you.

But you love someone else. <br>
But you want to be with someone else. <br>
And I can't believe how dumb I sound, <br>
And I will put my face over the ground <br>
And love you.
