<p>Spirit of my silence I can hear you</p>

<p>But I’m afraid to be near you</p>

<p><a href="#" id="note1" class="annotation-link">And I don’t know where to begin</a></p>

<p>And I don’t know where to begin</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Somewhere in the desert there’s a forest</p>

<p>And an acre before us</p>

<p>But I don’t know where to begin</p>

<p>But I don’t know where to begin</p>

<p><a href="#" id="note2" class="annotation-link">Again I’ve lost my strength completely</a>, oh be near me,</p>

<p>Tired old mare with the wind in your hair</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Amethyst and flowers on the table, is it real or a fable?</p>

<p>Well I suppose a friend is a friend</p>

<p>And we all know how this will end</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Chimney swift that finds me, be my keeper</p>

<p>Silhouette of the cedar</p>

<p>What is that song you sing for the dead?</p>

<p>What is that song you sing for the dead</p>

<p>I see the signal searchlight strike me in the window of my room</p>

<p>Well I got nothing to prove</p>

<p>Well I got nothing to prove</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I forgive you, mother, I can hear you</p>

<p>And I long to be near you</p>

<p>But every road leads to an end</p>

<p>Yes every road leads to an end</p>

<p>Your apparition passes through me in the willows:</p>

<p>Five red hens—you’ll never see us again</p>

<p>You’ll never see us again</p>
