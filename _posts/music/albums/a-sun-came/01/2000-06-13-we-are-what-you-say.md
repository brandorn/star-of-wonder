We are a servant, we have a song <br>
The side of a beehive, a tabernacle choir <br>
We are the sound working in wars <br>
The bishop is gone to the acolyte shores

We save our Bibles, we pull our sleeves <br>
The word is a guard and the guard is a cleave <br>
We are the right, we are the stay <br>
The accolade's gone, we are what you say

We have no language, we have no chore <br>
The side of a beehive, the bride is a whore <br>
We are a spite, we are at bay <br>
The spirit is life, we are what you say

We have a sermon, we have a song <br>
The bishop is easy, the bishop is wrong <br>
The spirit is right, the spirit will say <br>
We are a light, we are what you say
