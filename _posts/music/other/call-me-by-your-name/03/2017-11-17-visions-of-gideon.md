I have loved you for the last time <br>
Is it a video? Is it a video? <br>
I have touched you for the last time <br>
Is it a video? Is it a video?

For the love, for laughter, I flew up to your arms <br>
Is it a video? Is it a video? <br>
For the love, for laughter, I flew up to your arms <br>
Is it a video? Is it a video? <br>
Is it a video?

I have loved you for the last time <br>
Visions of Gideon, visions of Gideon <br>
And I have kissed you for the last time <br>
Visions of Gideon, visions of Gideon

For the love, for laughter, I flew up to your arms <br>
Is it a video? Is it a video? <br>
For the love, for laughter, I flew up to your arms <br>
Is it a video? Is it a video? <br>
For the love, for laughter, I flew up to your arms <br>
Visions of Gideon, visions of Gideon, <br>
For the love, for laughter, I flew up to your arms <br>
Visions of Gideon, visions of Gideon, visions of Gideon <br>
Is it a video?
