A government has gone this far <br>
A covenant prepared to part <br>
Peace to me

If I'm alone in saying, "yes" <br>
I'll change my views and try my best <br>
Peace to me 

Take it only if you boldly <br>
Cannot take it <br>
(Jumps and lonely) <br>
Presidents and magistration <br>
Spend on golf <br>
And spring vacation <br>
(Peace to me! <br>
We are the holy ones!)
